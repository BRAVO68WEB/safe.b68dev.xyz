      <div class="message-body">
        Unless I receive a copyright complain, or some other bullshit, I will.<br>
        However, we also have temporary uploads feature which will automatically delete your files after a certain period of time.<br>
        You can configure the feature through our homepage's config tab.

        Simply create a user on the site and every upload will be associated with your account, granting you access to your uploaded files through our dashboard.<br>

        Albums are a simple way of sorting uploads together.<br>
        As long as you are logged in, you can create albums through our homepage or dashboard,<br>
        then afterwards you can use them with our <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/lolisafe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Firefox extension</a> or <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/loli-safe-uploader/enkkmplljfjppcdaancckgilmgoiofnj" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chrome extension</a>,<br>
        which will enable you to <strong>right click -> send file to safe</strong>, or to a desired album if you have any.<br>
        You will have to set the domain in the extension's settings to <strong>https://safe.fiery.me</strong> though.

        Paris, France.<br>
        We are using <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/cdn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cloudflare</a> though, so you can expect your uploads to be delivered quickly all over the world after they have been cached.
      </div>
    </article>

    <h2 class='subtitle'>Since my uploads are cached, what about after I delete them from the dashboard?</h2>
    <article class="message">
      <div class="message-body">
        We will send API requests to Cloudflare to purge their cache immediately after you delete your uploads from the dashboard.<br>
        Cache of their thumbnails will also be purged, if applicable.

    <h2 class='subtitle'>Why is the maximum file size in the No-JS uploader form smaller?</h2>
    <article class="message">
      <div class="message-body">
        This site is using Cloudflare, which limits the maximum upload size.<br>
        Since the homepage uploader chunks your uploads through JS magic, it is possible to increase the maximum file size there.

    <h2 class='subtitle'>So your API supports chunked uploads?</h2>
    <article class="message">
      <div class="message-body">
        Yes, the homepage uploader was coded to chunk uploads into {{ chunkSize }} MB pieces by default (chunk size is configurable through the config tab).<br>
        If you want to chunk your API uploads, feel free to read the <a href="https://github.com/BobbyWibowo/lolisafe" target="_blank" rel="noopener">source code</a> to see how it works.
