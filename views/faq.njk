        Albums are a simple way of sorting uploads together.<br>
        As long as you are logged in, you can create albums through the homepage or the dashboard,<br>
        then afterwards you can use them with our <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/lolisafe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Firefox extension</a> or <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/loli-safe-uploader/enkkmplljfjppcdaancckgilmgoiofnj" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chrome extension</a>,<br>
        which will enable you to <strong>right click -> send file to safe</strong> or to a desired album if you have any.<br>
        You will have to set the domain in the extension's settings to <strong>https://safe.fiery.me</strong> though.

        Paris, France.<br>
        We are using Cloudflare though, so you can expect your uploads to be delivered quickly all over the world after they have been cached.

    <article class="message">
      <div class="message-body">
        This site is using Cloudflare, which limits the maximum upload size.<br>
        Since the homepage uploader chunks your uploads through JS magic, it is possible to increase the maximum file size there.

        Yes, the homepage uploader is hard-coded to chunk uploads into {{ chunkSize }} pieces by default.<br>
